When executing an Action, Frame.io sends a payload to a URL you provide.

The behavior for individual Files is straightforward, as the ID will reflect the specific File the Action was executed on. Likewise for Folders, you'll be receiving the ID for the Folder the Action was executed on; however, depending on your use-case you have multiple options when defining your Action's behavior. Use the Folder ID to make subsequent calls to the Frame.io API if you want to interact with the Folder resource itself. Alternatively, you may want to get the children of that Folder in order to perform further processing on the assets within. When an action is Executed on a Version Stack, your payload will contain the ID for the 'Head Asset', which is the top-most File in the Stack and is what is shown in the Frame.io UI.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You can read more about the differences between the Frame.io Legacy API and V4 in our `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://developer.adobe.com/frameio/guides/Migration/\"\n      }}>{`Migration Guide`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"beta-feedback\"\n    }}>{`Beta Feedback`}</h2>\n    <p>{`We'd love to hear from developers and end-users about the ways you'd like to use Actions in Frame.io V4.
