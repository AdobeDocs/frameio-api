# Draft: Auth to Upload

This guide describes the authorization to file upload flow for the [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) V4 API.  

## Prerequisites

* [Overview of Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/)
* [How To Refresh Access Tokens](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/UserAuthentication/ims#refreshing-access-tokens)
* [How To Upload a New File](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/)
* [Fetching Access tokens](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/UserAuthentication/ims#fetching-access-tokens)
* [Uploading a New File](https://developer.adobe.com/frameio/guides/#uploading-a-new-file)

## Adobe Authorization

Follow the guidance on the Adobe Developer Console [Authentication Guide](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/) to join and build with the [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) V4 API safely. Follow the steps in [Getting Started with the Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/getting-started/) to create an Adobe Developer Console Project with a [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) API subscription configured with the appropriate credential type for your application.

## Credential and Token creation

View, add, and manage credentials required for your application to connect safely and securely to external services. Configure your event registration to access authentication credentials. This could be a OAuth Server-to-Server credential or OAuth User authentication credential, depending on the type of event being configured.

## Add an API

Using APIs allows your application to makes call to Adobe services by means of a REST API. APIs can be connected to your app in multiple ways, depending on the API or the type of app that you are building. To learn more about each of these authentication methods or API connections, read the [authentication documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/).

* [Add an API using OAuth User authentication credential](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/services/services-add-api-oauth-user-authentication)
* [Add an API using API Key authentication](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/services/services-add-api-key)

# Upload a New File

There are two ways to upload a new file: create file (local upload) and create file (remote upload).

* To create a file through local upload, select the **create file (local upload)** endpoint. The request body requires the file name and its file size.

* If the request is successful, then a placeholder file resource will be created without any content. Depending on the file size, the response body will include one or more `upload_urls`. See [Multi-part Upload](http://multi-part%20upload/) for next steps.

* To create a file through remote upload, select the **create file (remote upload)** endpoint. The request body requires the file name and its source url.

## Multi-part Upload  

After creating a placeholder file through the the **create file (local upload)** endpoint, you will have one or more upload urls. These upload urls are required to make upload requests. It may be useful to compose a shell script that splits up the source file into chunks and issues the same number of subsequent requests. There are several important details to note about sending the subsequent upload requests:

* The HTTP request method must be PUT.
* The `x-amz-acl` header must be included and be set to private.
* The `Content-Type` header must match the `media_type` specified in the original **create file (local upload)** request. This is true even when uploading the file as separate parts.

In the sample Python script below, weâ€™re passing in one upload url in the `upload_urls` parameter, though as noted above, you may have more than one provided to you based on the file size set in the request body for **create file (local upload).**

``` python
