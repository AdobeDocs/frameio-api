## Executing Actions

Navigate to any File, Folder, or Version Stack and invoke the context menu by selecting the three dots (or right-clicking) and navigate to the sub menu for custom Actions. 

Any active Actions configured for the Workspace you're in will be displayed. If there are no Actions enabled in your Workspace, this menu item will be greyed out. If you do have Actions available, simply select one to execute it. The user will be presented with a success message or a modal with form fileds to fill out depending on your Action's use case. We also support error messaging in case your Action fails to execute or the URL provided is unreachable. You can read more about common issues with troubleshooting and debugging tips at the end of this guide.
