# Custom Actions

Frame.io Actions provide quick access to common media operations like downloading, renaming, and duplicating items â€“ and also allow for integrations with 3rd party tools and services to be surfaced directly within the user interface of [Frame.io](https://next.frame.io/).

With the introduction of custom Actions (beta), developers can now configure and manage their own Actions in Frame.io V4. Leveraging the same underlying Event system as [Webhooks](https://developer.adobe.com/frameio/guides/Webhooks/), custom Actions are an alternative mechanism for developers to connect their assets to the tools that matter most to the users in their Frame.io Account.

Actions can be executed by any user that is a Member of the Frame.io Workspace the Action is enabled in. When executing an Action, Frame.io sends a payload to a URL you provide. The receiving application responds with an HTTP status code to acknowledge receipt, or with a custom callback to render additional form fields in the Frame.io UI. The receiving application can be your own hosted program, service, or even low-code/no-code IPaaS tool like Workfront Fusion or Zapier. For more detailed information about these options visit Deploying Actions.

## Migrated Actions

There are a few things to keep in mind when migrating to a Frame.io V4 Account containing custom Actions created in the Frame.io Legacy application.

### Action Status

Upon Account migration to Frame.io V4, all custom Actions created in earlier versions will have a status of 'null' and will be automatically disabled. This provides users the opportunity to first update your Actions to use the V4 API before enabling as any Actions not updated will fail. To identify Actions in this state vist the Actions Settings page and reference the column "Status" or, if using the API, by checking the is_active field.

### Actionable Reources: Files, Folders & Version Stacks

Given the separation of concerns between different asset types in the Frame.io V4 API, there is new behavior you may want consider when interpreting the resource ID recieved in your Action's payload. The behavior for individual Files is straight-forward, as the ID will reflect the specific File the Action was executed on. Likewise for Folders, you'll be recieving the ID for the Folder the Action was executed on; however, depending on your usecase you have multiple options when defining your Action's behavior. Use the Folder ID to make subsequent calls to the Frame.io API if you want interact with the Folder resource itself. Alternatively, you may want to get the children of that Folder in order to perform further processing on the assets within. When an action is Executed on a Version Stack, your payload will contain the ID for the 'Head Asset', which is the top most File in the Stack and is what is shown in the Frame.io UI.
