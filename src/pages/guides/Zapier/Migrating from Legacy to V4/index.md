# Migrating from Legacy to V4

Frame.io's V4 Zapier integration brings significant improvements while maintaining feature parity with our legacy version. Here's everything you need to know about the differences and how to make the transition smoothly.

## Making the Switch

### For Existing Users

If you're currently using the legacy [Frame.io Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/apps/frameio/integrations), your existing Zaps will only work with the legacy version of Frame.io. Once you've upgraded your Frame.io Account to V4, you'll need to rebuild your integrations using the [Frame.io V4 Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/apps/frameio-v4/integrations).

### For New Users

Always choose the **Frame.io V4** integration when creating new Zaps. It's the current, actively maintained version with all the latest improvements.

## Key Terminology Changes

The most noticeable change is in our language around content organization:

### Legacy → V4 Terminology

- **"Asset"** → **"File"** or **"File & Folder"**
- **"Asset Created"** → **"File Created"
- **"Asset Ready"** → **"File Ready"**
- **"Asset Upload Completed"** → **"File Upload Completed"**

**Why the change?** The term "File" is more universally understood and accurately describes what you're working with—whether it's a video, image, document, or any other file type. "Asset" was Frame.io-specific terminology that could be confusing for users coming from other platforms.

## Need a Missing Feature?

### How to Reach Out

- **Community Forum**: Post in our [Frame.io Community](https://forum.frame.io/) for feature requests
- **Support Team**: Contact our support team directly through the Frame.io app

### What to Include

When requesting features or reporting issues:
- Describe the specific workflow you're trying to achieve, the error you're seeing, or where you're getting stuck
- Let us know if this worked in the legacy version or if this is a new V4-specific feature
