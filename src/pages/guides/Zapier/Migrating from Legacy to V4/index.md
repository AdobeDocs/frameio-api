# Migrating from Legacy to V4

Frame.io's V4 Zapier integration brings significant improvements while maintaining feature parity with our legacy version. Here's everything you need to know about the differences and how to make the transition smoothly.

## Making the Switch

### For Existing Users
If you're currently using the legacy Frame.io Zapier integration, your existing Zaps will continue to work. However, we recommend migrating to V4 since we’ve phased out support for legacy integrations to focus on improving our latest features.

### For New Users
Always choose the **Frame.io V4** integration when creating new Zaps. It's the current, actively maintained version with all the latest improvements.

## Key Terminology Changes

The most noticeable change is in our language around content organization:

### Legacy → V4 Terminology
- **"Asset"** → **"File"** or **"File & Folder"**
- **"Asset Created"** → **"File Created"** 
- **"Asset Ready"** → **"File Ready"**
- **"Asset Upload Completed"** → **"File Upload Completed"**

**Why the change?** The term "File" is more universally understood and accurately describes what you're working with—whether it's a video, image, document, or any other file type. "Asset" was Frame.io-specific terminology that could be confusing for users coming from other platforms.

## Need a Missing Feature?

**We're here to help!** Our goal was to match all features between Legacy and V4, but if you notice something missing or need additional functionality:

### How to Reach Out
- **Community Forum**: Post in our [Frame.io Community](https://forum.frame.io/) for feature requests
- **Support Team**: Contact our support team directly through the Frame.io app
- **Integration Feedback**: We actively monitor and respond to integration feedback

### What to Include
When requesting features or reporting issues:
- Describe the specific workflow you're trying to achieve
- Let us know if this worked in the legacy version
- Share your use case

**We're committed to making V4 the best possible experience** and regularly add new features based on user feedback. Your input directly influences our development roadmap.
