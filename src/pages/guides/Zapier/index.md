# Introduction to Zapier

Transform your Frame.io workflows with simple, no-code automation that anyone can set up in minutes with no technical expertise required.

## What is Zapier?

**Zapier is your digital assistant that connects your favorite apps automatically.** Think of it as a bridge that lets your apps "talk" to each other without you having to do anything manually.

The magic happens through simple "if this, then that" rules called [**Zaps**](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496309697421-What-is-a-Zap). For example: "When a new video is uploaded to Frame.io, automatically create a share link to send to my team." That's itâ€”no coding, no complex setup, just point-and-click simplicity.

With over [7,000+ apps available](https://zapier.com/apps), Zapier turns repetitive, mundane tasks into automated workflows, giving you and your team more time to focus on the most important work.

## Why Use Frame.io with Zapier?

Frame.io's [Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/apps/frameio-v4/integrations) brings the power of automation to your file workflows. Instead of manually checking for new uploads, copying links, or sending status updates, you can set up automated workflows that handle these tasks for you.

**Popular automation examples:**

- **New upload notifications**: Automatically notify your team in Slack when someone uploads a new video
- **Project management sync**: Create tasks in Airtable when new Frame.io projects are created
- **Client communication**: Send email updates to clients when their review is ready
- **File organization**: Automatically save approved assets to Google Drive or Dropbox
- **Status tracking**: Update project status in your CRM when comments are resolved

## Getting Started is Easier Than You Think

**No coding knowledge required.** Zapier's visual interface guides you through each step:

1. **Choose your trigger**: "When this happens in Frame.io..." (like a new upload)
2. **Select your action**: "Do this in another app..." (like send a Slack message)
3. **Map your data**: Choose what information to share between apps
4. **Test and activate**: Zapier shows you exactly what will happen before going live

The whole process takes just a few minutes, and Zapier provides helpful [templates](https://zapier.com/apps/frameio-v4/integrations#integrations) to get you started even faster.

## Ready to Automate?

The best part about automation is that you start small and grow from there. Begin with one simple workflow, like getting notified when someone comments on your project, and expand as you see the time-saving benefits.

Your apps are already doing great work. Now let them work together to do even more.
