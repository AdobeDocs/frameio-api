## Overview

### About Frame.io

Frame.io provides a flexible, fast and intuitive platform that empowers creative teams and their stakeholders to organize, review and manage work in progress assets, and orchestrate the people and processes supporting them. Anchored in an all-new, powerful metadata framework, teams can now use Frame.io to customize any creative workflow centered on media assets.

### Frame.io V4 API Requirements

To use the endpoints described here, you must first have a provisioned Frame.io V4 account administered via the Adobe Admin Console. If your account is on legacy version of Frame.io, please refer to our [legacy Developer Documentation](https://developer.frame.io/docs/).

### About Frame.io V4 Developer Platform 

The Frame.io developer platform has been redesigned from the ground up to make creative collaboration clear and simple. New concepts that will make your creative life easier include role-based access controls, custom fields to fit the way your team works, and the simplification of Shares. We designed the brand new API that you interact and build with to best suit our customer and partner needs.

In these docs you’ll find a comprehensive Getting Started Guide that walks you through core concepts and details the full V4 API surface area– paying special attention to any differences for those migrating from V3. We’ve also included human and machine-readable API Reference documentation. Generated using the Open API specification, developers can refer to the Frame.io API Reference for a full list of supported endpoints with sample requests and responses, including error information. In the top nav of the website, developers can switch between versions where we’ll be surfacing an ‘experimental’ version for anyone looking to peak into new endpoints still under active development. Endpoints in this section should be referenced directionally only, as the routes and response bodies are subject to change before officially released under a supported version header.

### Support 

If you need additional support beyond what’s covered in these documents, please reach out to the Frame.io Support Team for assistance by chatting with us on our [Support Site](https://support.frame.io/en/) . Please note that Enterprise customers may be directed to their Customer Success Manager.
